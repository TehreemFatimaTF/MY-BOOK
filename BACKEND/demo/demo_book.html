            <div class="chapter-title">Chapter 1: What is AI?</div>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create software or machines that exhibit human-like intelligence. This can include learning from experience, understanding natural language, solving problems, and recognizing patterns.</p>
            <p>AI technology is already present in our daily lives, from recommendation systems on streaming platforms to voice assistants on our smartphones. The field of AI encompasses various subfields including machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, and computer vision.</p>

            <div class="chapter-title">Chapter 2: Machine Learning Fundamentals</div>
            <p>Machine learning is a subset of AI that focuses on building systems that can learn from data without being explicitly programmed. Instead of following static instructions, these systems use statistical techniques to improve their performance with experience.</p>
            <p>There are three main types of machine learning: supervised learning, where the model learns from labeled data; unsupervised learning, where the model finds patterns in unlabeled data; and reinforcement learning, where the model learns through trial and error by receiving rewards or penalties.</p>

            <div class="chapter-title">Chapter 3: Neural Networks</div>
            <p>Neural networks are computing systems inspired by the human brain. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) that work together to solve complex problems. Each connection has a weight that adjusts as the network learns from data.</p>
            <p>Deep learning refers to neural networks with multiple layers. These deep networks can learn hierarchical representations of data, with early layers learning simple features and deeper layers learning more complex patterns. This makes them particularly effective for tasks like image and speech recognition.</p>
